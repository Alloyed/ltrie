# Ltrie

Ltrie is a collection of immutable datastructures patterned after
Clojure's datastructures and immutable.js

## TODO

Find a way to trick luafun into thinking the collections are also
wrapped iterators

Explicitly document when a collection implements a given interface

To Document:
* Subvec
* Hashmap

Unimplemented datastructures:
* transients
* hashset
* ordered map
* compound vector/hash
