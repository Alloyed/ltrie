# Ltrie

Ltrie is a collection of immutable datastructures patterned after
Clojure's datastructures and immutable.js

# Bugs/TODO

* hashmap:dissoc() is broken
* transients aren't implemented
* hash function isn't optimized for equal distribution

Unimplemented datastructures:
* hashset
* ordered map
* compound vector/hash
